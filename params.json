This special session will bring together scientists from biology and computer science to explore emerging topics in personalized medicine. This session is timely given the new [Precision Medicine Initiative](https://www.nih.gov/precision-medicine-initiative-cohort-program) by the NIH. It will consist of two exciting sub-sessions. The first sub-session will explore genomics research in underserved human populations and sex differences in complex traits. The second session will highlight the broad spectrum of challenges and opportunities in precision medicine, including translational genomics, electronic health record (EHR) analytics, and drug discovery.\r\n\r\n### Sub-session 1: Precision Medicine for All\r\nGenomic studies that focus on potential population and sex differences are crucial to ensure the community does not contribute to healthcare disparities. How the genetic architectures of complex traits vary between populations is not well understood, in part due to the [historical paucity](http://www.nature.com/news/genomics-is-failing-on-diversity-1.20759?WT.mc_id=TWT_NatureNews) of genome-wide association studies in populations of non-European ancestry. The genetic contribution to population phenotypic differentiation is driven by differences in causal allele frequencies, effect sizes, and genetic architectures. Such differences will affect predictive power and need to be systematically characterized. In addition, despite the [critical importance of biological sex](http://www.nature.com/news/policy-nih-to-balance-sex-in-cell-and-animal-studies-1.15195) in all areas of development and disease, relatively few attempts have been made to address the complexity of sexual dimorphism in genetic studies of disease and pharmacogenomics phenotypes. In this sub-session, we will highlight the work of those performing genomics research in underserved populations and/or exploring the sex differences/similarities underlying complex traits. We invite abstracts for oral presentation on the following topics: \r\n- population structure/differentiation\r\n- local ancestry/admixture \r\n- sex chromosome dosage compensation\r\n- sex-biased genetic effects \r\n- integrative genomics applications in underserved populations \r\n\r\n### Sub-session 2: Translational Genomics, EHR Analytics, & Drug Discovery\r\n\r\n### Organizers\r\n- [Heather Wheeler](http://hewlab15.org) Loyola University Chicago\r\n- [Hammad Naveed](mailto:hammad.naveed@ttic.edu) Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago, Chicago\r\n- [Aly Khan](mailto:aakhan@ttic.edu) Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago, Chicago\r\n \r\n",
