  "body": "As human genomics research progresses towards an era of more sophisticated integrative and predictive modeling, more clinically relevant results are likely to be discovered. Omics studies that focus on potential population and sex differences are crucial to ensure the community does not contribute to healthcare disparities. How the genetic architectures of complex traits vary between populations is not well understood, in part due to the [historical paucity](http://www.nature.com/news/genomics-is-failing-on-diversity-1.20759?WT.mc_id=TWT_NatureNews) of genome-wide association studies in populations of non-European ancestry. The genetic contribution to population phenotypic differentiation is driven by differences in causal allele frequencies, effect sizes, and genetic architectures. Such differences will affect predictive power and need to be systematically characterized. In addition, despite the critical importance of biological sex in all areas of development and disease, relatively few attempts have been made to address the complexity of sexual dimorphism in genetic studies of disease and pharmacogenomics phenotypes. Several diseases display sex biases in prevalence, clinical features and prognosis, including autoimmune diseases, which are more common in females and infectious diseases, which are more common in males.\r\n\r\nIn this session, we will highlight the work of those performing genomics research in underserved populations and/or exploring the sex differences/similarities underlying complex traits. This session is timely given the new [Precision Medicine Initiative](https://www.nih.gov/precision-medicine-initiative-cohort-program) by the NIH. A better understanding of the degree of transferability of genetic association results and the underlying mechanisms of implicated genes across populations and sexes is essential for precision medicine implementation. Comprehension of the methodological challenges involved and how to overcome them is key for those in the bioinformatics community implementing such analyses. For example, presenters in this session will discuss how to model population structure, local ancestry, sex chromosome dosage compensation, and sex-biased genetic effects as well as applications of such models and what they reveal about the biology of a particular trait. Omics studies exploring these themes will be presented by students and postdocs in this two-hour session. The intended audience for this session includes those interested in statistical genetics, statistical modeling, human population genetics, and integrative genomics. \r\n",
